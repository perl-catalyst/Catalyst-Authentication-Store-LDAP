1.007  19 Mar 2010
   - Store the user password for the ldap_connection method in an inside

     an LDAP connection bound as the user who authenticated.

     bad LDAP queries.

     auth system to use ->authenticate instead of ->login, and not say that
     you need to do things manually to have multiple stores. (t0m)

0.1004  21 Oct 2008
   - Add the ability to have the user inflated into a custom
     user class with the user_class option (t0m)

    - Added support for entry_class in the same way that Catalyst::Model::LDAP
      supports it, allowing one to override what class is returned from
